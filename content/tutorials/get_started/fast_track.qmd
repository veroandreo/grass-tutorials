In this notebook we will walk you through **5 simple steps** to get you started 
with GRASS using its graphical user interface (GUI).

If you want to use Python or R, check out tutorials to get started with
[GRASS in Jupyter Notebooks](fast_track_grass_and_python.qmd) or [R](fast_track_grass_and_R.qmd).

## Step 1: Install the software

GRASS is available on Windows, Linux and macOS. The binaries for Windows and
macOS can be found at <https://grass.osgeo.org/download/>.
We recommend using the **current** release version.

GRASS package [is available for many Linux distributions](https://grass.osgeo.org/download/linux/).
Let's see an example of how to install GRASS on **Linux/Ubuntu**:

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntugis/ubuntugis-unstable
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install grass grass-gui grass-dev
```

## Step 2: Open GRASS

Just double click on the GRASS ![](images/grass-32x32.png) icon.
You will get the GUI and terminal. You can use GRASS tools in either.
It's a matter of taste, task on hand and habit, too.

The GRASS GUI has a single window layout by default, but it is also possible to 
minimize and/or dock/undock the panels. On the left, you can find the **data** 
browser which allows you to navigate through your projects and data, and the 
**layers** panel showing displayed layers. The panel in the middle is the 
**map display**. You can add additional map displays if you need using 
![](images/monitor-create.png). Finally, on the right there are multiple tabs 
where you can find a searchable **tools' tree** similar to the Processing 
toolbox in QGIS, a **console** where you can type GRASS commands, 
the **history of executed commands** in case you want to re-run a task and a 
simple **Python console** where you can use the GRASS Python API.

## Step 3: Create a project

When you open GRASS for the first time, a new directory is created in your
home folder. This directory is called **grassdata** by default and stores all 
your GRASS projects. GRASS **projects** are simply folders storing your 
geospatial data with common coordinate reference system (CRS), ensuring 
consistency of your data.
At the project level, data is further organized into subprojects called 
**mapsets**, which you can use to manage different subregions or analyses within 
a project. Each project contains a special mapset called *PERMANENT*, which is 
used to store source datasets for your analysis that can be easily accessed from 
other mapsets.

Within the grassdata directory you will see a sample project called 
*world_latlong_wgs84* which contains the PERMANENT mapset, with a sample vector 
layer. 
While there are other [sample data sets](https://grass.osgeo.org/download/data/) 
that you could download to play around with GRASS and test it, you most 
likely have some data of your own that you want to process and analyse.
Therefore, the third step is to create a new project and select its CRS by its
name, EPSG code or take it from your input data. Let's see a simple way to 
create a project in GRASS GUI. You can either click over "Create new project" 
in the info bar or use ![](images/project-add.png) icon.

## Step 4: Import your data

Once you have created your GRASS project, you'll notice it contains the 
PERMANENT mapset inside. You can import your data there or optionally you could
create other mapsets to organize your work.

Why do we need to import data? GRASS has a native format for raster and vector
data to facilitate robust and efficient analysis and manipulation of geospatial 
data. One advantage of this structure is that you can easily zip your mapsets 
or projects to share with your colleagues. And guess what? Not only data will 
be there but also the history of commands you have executed on them!

So, how do we import data? Let's see an example for raster and vector data 
formats. For imports with optional re-projection, you can use
![](images/raster-import.png) and ![](images/vector-import.png) icons from the 
Data panel bar.

In the first case, we import 10m resolution bands from Copernicus Sentinel 2 
scenes that can be found
[here](https://grass.osgeo.org/sampledata/north_carolina/nc_sentinel_utm17n.zip). 
Note that we can import all files within a directory if we specify the 
extension of such files, `jp2` in this case.

![](images/import_raster.png){width=50%}

In another example, we import a GeoPackage with different CRS. Data will be
automatically reprojected.

![](images/import_vector_with_reprojection.png){width=55%}

Maps will be added to the layer tree and displayed automatically. 

![](images/raster_and_vector_imported.png){width=75%}

## Step 5: Set the computational region

The last important step, especially if you are working with raster data, is to 
set the **computational region**. This is the *extent and resolution* of your 
region of interest or study area, and it will affect all your raster processing,
i.e., *output rasters will have their extent and spatial resolution equal to the computational region*. 
You can set the computational region to the extent of a vector map, to the 
extent and resolution of a raster map or manually introducing the north, south,
east, and west coordinates.

Why do we need a computational region? When combining data with different 
resolution and extents, it helps keeping results consistent. Also, raster data 
might be large and running processes on them might take a while. Setting a 
smaller computational region allows you to test your algorithms and parameter 
values without the need to clip input maps, so once you are happy with the 
result, you can run the process for the whole raster extent.  

![](images/region.png){width=60%}

The computational region can be changed interactively from the map display 
by selecting a region with your mouse, or using the `g.region` tool both 
from the GUI and command line.

* Interactive:

![](images/set_region_interactively.png){width=65%}

* Using `g.region` from the contextual menu after right click on a layer:

![](images/grass_gui_set_region_contextual_menu.png){width=70%}

* Using `g.region` from the main menu in the GUI:

![](images/set_region_gui.png){width=70%}

Note how commands are formed when you select options in the GUI. If you use 
the <Copy> button, you can then paste these in a text file and set the basis 
of your protocol, which can then be generalized into a script or even your own
GRASS tool.

![](images/region_set.png){width=60%}

* From the console tab or in the terminal:

```
g.region -p raster=myraster
```
