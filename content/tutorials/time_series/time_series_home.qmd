**GRASS** offers robust tools for working with spatiotemporal data, especially raster time series. This page collects all the tutorials that focus on time series workflows, from creating space-time datasets to performing time-aware analysis and visualizations.

Whether you're just getting started or looking to perform advanced temporal algebra, you'll find a range of examples below.

## ðŸ“š Tutorial Collection

Here are the available tutorials, ordered to guide you from basic to more advanced concepts:

1. **[Introduction to Time Series in GRASS](./time_series_management_and_visualization.qmd)**  
   Learn the basics of space-time datasets and time series visualization.

2. **[Temporal aggregations](./time_series_aggregations.qmd)**  
   Group and summarize time series data by week, month, or season.

3. **[Temporal algebra](./time_series_algebra.qmd)**  
   Use temporal algebra to query and analyze space-time datasets based on time relations.

4. **[Temporal accumulation](./time_series_accumulations.qmd)**  
   Compute cumulative temperature values over time and find suitable areas for mosquitoes.

5. **[Temporal gap-filling](./time_series_gap_filling.qmd)**  
   Fill missing values using temporal interpolation and smoothing techniques.

6. **[Temporal query with vector data](./time_series_query_with_vector.qmd_)**  
   Extract time series values at specific vector locations (e.g., points or polygons).

7. **[Temporal subset, import and export](./time_series_extraction.qmd)**  
   Subset time series by date, and learn how to import/export space-time datasets effectively.
